MY SUFFERING LEFT ME SAD AND GLOOMY   ACADEMIC STUDY AND THE STEADY  MINDFUL PRACTICE OF RELIGION SLOWLY WROUGHT ME BACK TO LIFE  I HAVE KEPT UP WITH WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER MY STRANGE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES  AFTER ONE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL  I ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO AND TOOK A DOUBLE MAJOR BACHELOR’S DEGREE  MY MAJORS WERE RELIGIOUS STUDIES AND ZOOLOGY  MY FOURTH YEAR THESIS FOR RELIGIOUS STUDIES CONCERNED CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COSMOGONY THEORY OF ISAAC LURIA  THE GREAT SIXTEENTH CENTURY KABBALIST FROM SAFED  MY ZOOLOGY THESIS WAS A FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE THYROID GLAND OF THE THREE TOED SLOTH  I CHOSE THE SLOTH BECAUSE ITS DEMEANOUR CALM  QUIET AND INTROSPECTIVE DID SOMETHING TO SOOTHE MY SHATTERED SELF   THERE ARE TWO TOED SLOTHS AND THERE ARE THREE TOED SLOTHS  THE CASE BEING DETERMINED BY THE FOREPAWS OF THE ANIMALS  SINCE ALL SLOTHS HAVE THREE CLAWS ON THEIR HIND PAWS  I HAD THE GREAT LUCK ONE SUMMER OF STUDYING THE THREE TOED SLOTH IN SITU IN THE EQUATORIAL JUNGLES OF BRAZIL  IT IS A HIGHLY INTRIGUING CREATURE  ITS ONLY REAL HABIT IS INDOLENCE  IT SLEEPS OR RESTS ON AVERAGE TWENTY HOURS A DAY  OUR TEAM TESTED THE SLEEP HABITS OF FIVE WILD THREE TOED SLOTHS BY PLACING ON THEIR HEADS  IN THE EARLY EVENING AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP  BRIGHT RED PLASTIC DISHES FILLED WITH WATER  WE FOUND THEM STILL IN PLACE LATE THE NEXT MORNING  THE WATER OF THE DISHES SWARMING WITH INSECTS  THE SLOTH IS AT ITS   BUSIEST AT SUNSET  USING THE WORD BUSY HERE IN THE MOST RELAXED SENSE  IT MOVES ALONG THE BOUGH OF A TREE IN ITS CHARACTERISTIC UPSIDE DOWN POSITION AT THE SPEED OF ROUGHLY     METRES AN HOUR  ON THE GROUND  IT CRAWLS TO ITS NEXT TREE AT THE RATE OF     METRES AN HOUR  WHEN MOTIVATED  WHICH IS     TIMES SLOWER THAN A MOTIVATED CHEETAH  UNMOTIVATED  IT COVERS FOUR TO FIVE METRES IN AN HOUR   THE THREE TOED SLOTH IS NOT WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD  ON A SCALE OF   TO     WHERE   REPRESENTS UNUSUAL DULLNESS AND    EXTREME ACUITY  BEEBE        GAVE THE SLOTHS SENSES OF TASTE  TOUCH  SIGHT AND HEARING A RATING OF    AND ITS SENSE OF SMELL A RATING OF    IF YOU COME UPON A SLEEPING THREE TOED SLOTH IN THE WILD  TWO OR THREE NUDGES SHOULD SUFFICE TO AWAKEN IT  IT WILL THEN LOOK SLEEPILY IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT YOURS  WHY IT SHOULD LOOK ABOUT IS UNCERTAIN SINCE THE SLOTH SEES EVERYTHING IN A MAGOO LIKE BLUR  AS FOR HEARING  THE SLOTH IS NOT SO MUCH DEAF AS UNINTERESTED IN SOUND  BEEBE REPORTED THAT FIRING GUNS NEXT TO SLEEPING OR FEEDING SLOTHS ELICITED LITTLE REACTION  AND THE SLOTH’S SLIGHTLY BETTER SENSE OF SMELL SHOULD NOT BE OVERESTIMATED  THEY ARE SAID TO BE ABLE TO SNIFF AND AVOID DECAYED BRANCHES  BUT BULLOCK        REPORTED THAT SLOTHS FALL TO THE GROUND CLINGING TO DECAYED BRANCHES  OFTEN    HOW DOES IT SURVIVE  YOU MIGHT ASK   PRECISELY BY BEING SO SLOW  SLEEPINESS AND SLOTHFULNESS KEEP IT OUT OF HARM’S WAY  AWAY FROM THE NOTICE OF JAGUARS  OCELOTS  HARPY EAGLES AND ANACONDAS  A SLOTH’S HAIRS SHELTER AN ALGAE THAT IS BROWN DURING THE DRY SEASON AND GREEN DURING THE WET SEASON  SO THE ANIMAL BLENDS IN WITH THE SURROUNDING MOSS AND FOLIAGE AND LOOKS LIKE A NEST OF WHITE ANTS OR OF SQUIRRELS  OR LIKE NOTHING AT ALL BUT PART OF A TREE   THE THREE TOED SLOTH LIVES A PEACEFUL  VEGETARIAN LIFE IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT   A GOOD NATURED SMILE IS FOREVER ON ITS LIPS   REPORTED TIRLER         I HAVE SEEN THAT SMILE WITH MY OWN EYES  I AM NOT ONE GIVEN TO PROJECTING HUMAN TRAITS AND EMOTIONS ONTO ANIMALS  BUT MANY A TIME DURING THAT MONTH IN BRAZIL  LOOKING UP AT SLOTHS IN REPOSE  I FELT I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF UPSIDE DOWN YOGIS DEEP IN MEDITATION OR HERMITS DEEP IN PRAYER  WISE BEINGS WHOSE INTENSE IMAGINATIVE LIVES WERE BEYOND THE REACH OF MY SCIENTIFIC PROBING   SOMETIMES I GOT MY MAJORS MIXED UP  A NUMBER OF MY FELLOW RELIGIOUS STUDIES STUDENTS  MUDDLED AGNOSTICS WHO DIDN’T KNOW WHICH WAY WAS UP  WHO WERE IN THE THRALL OF REASON  THAT FOOL’S GOLD FOR THE BRIGHT REMINDED ME OF THE THREE TOED SLOTH  AND THE THREE TOED SLOTH  SUCH A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF THE MIRACLE OF LIFE  REMINDED ME OF GOD   I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY FELLOW SCIENTISTS  SCIENTISTS ARE A FRIENDLY  ATHEISTIC  HARD WORKING  BEER DRINKING LOT WHOSE MINDS ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH SEX  CHESS AND BASEBALL WHEN THEY ARE NOT PREOCCUPIED WITH SCIENCE   I WAS A VERY GOOD STUDENT  IF I MAY SAY SO MYSELF  I WAS TOPS AT ST  MICHAEL’S COLLEGE FOUR YEARS IN A ROW  I GOT EVERY POSSIBLE STUDENT AWARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY  IF I GOT NONE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES  IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STUDENT AWARDS IN THIS DEPARTMENT  THE REWARDS OF RELIGIOUS STUDY ARE NOT IN MORTAL HANDS  WE ALL KNOW THAT   I WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE GOVERNOR GENERAL’S ACADEMIC MEDAL  THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO’S HIGHEST UNDERGRADUATE AWARD  OF WHICH NO SMALL NUMBER OF ILLUSTRIOUS CANADIANS HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS  WERE IT NOT FOR A BEEF EATING PINK BOY WITH A NECK LIKE A TREE TRUNK AND A TEMPERAMENT OF UNBEARABLE GOOD CHEER   I STILL SMART A LITTLE AT THE SLIGHT  WHEN YOU’VE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL IN LIFE  EACH ADDITIONAL PAIN IS BOTH UNBEARABLE AND TRIFLING  MY LIFE IS LIKE A MEMENTO MORI PAINTING FROM EUROPEAN ART  THERE IS ALWAYS A GRINNING SKULL AT MY SIDE TO REMIND ME OF THE FOLLY OF HUMAN AMBITION  I MOCK THIS SKULL  I LOOK AT IT AND I SAY   YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG FELLOW  YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IN LIFE  BUT I DON’T BELIEVE IN DEATH  MOVE ON   THE SKULL SNICKERS AND MOVES EVER CLOSER  BUT THAT DOESN’T SURPRISE ME  THE REASON DEATH STICKS SO CLOSELY TO LIFE ISN’T BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY IT’ S ENVY  UIFE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT DEATH HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH IT  A JEALOUS  POSSESSIVE LOVE THAT GRABS AT WHAT IT CAN  BUT LIFE LEAPS OVER OBLIVION LIGHTLY  LOSING ONLY A THING OR TWO OF NO IMPORTANCE  AND GLOOM IS BUT THE PASSING SHADOW OF A CLOUD  THE PINK BOY ALSO GOT THE NOD FROM THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE  I LOVE HIM AND I HOPE HIS TIME AT OXFORD WAS A RICH EXPERIENCE  IF UAKSHMI  GODDESS OF WEALTH  ONE DAY FAVOURS ME BOUNTIFULLY  OXFORD IS FIFTH ON THE LIST OF CITIES I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT BEFORE I PASS ON  AFTER    MECCA  VARANASI  JERUSALEM AND PARIS   I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY OF MY WORKING LIFE  ONLY THAT A TIE IS A NOOSE  AND INVERTED THOUGH IT IS  IT WILL HANG A MAN NONETHELESS IF HE’S NOT CAREFUL   I LOVE CANADA  I MISS THE HEAT OF INDIA  THE FOOD  THE HOUSE LIZARDS ON THE WALLS  THE MUSICALS ON THE SILVER SCREEN  THE COWS WANDERING THE STREETS  THE CROWS CAWING  EVEN THE TALK OF CRICKET MATCHES  BUT I LOVE CANADA  IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY MUCH TOO COLD FOR GOOD SENSE  INHABITED BY COMPASSIONATE  INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WITH BAD HAIRDOS  ANYWAY  I HAVE NOTHING TO GO HOME TO IN PONDICHERRY   RICHARD PARKER HAS STAYED WITH ME  I’VE NEVER FORGOTTEN HIM  DARE I SAY I MISS HIM  I DO  I MISS HIM  I STILL SEE HIM IN MY DREAMS  THEY ARE NIGHTMARES MOSTLY  BUT NIGHTMARES TINGED WITH LOVE  SUCH IS THE STRANGENESS OF THE HUMAN HEART  I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD ABANDON ME SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY  WITHOUT ANY SORT OF GOODBYE  WITHOUT LOOKING BACK EVEN ONCE  THAT PAIN IS LIKE AN AXE THAT CHOPS AT MY HEART   THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AT THE HOSPITAL IN MEXICO WERE INCREDIBLY KIND TO ME  AND THE PATIENTS  TOO  VICTIMS OF CANCER OR CAR ACCIDENTS  ONCE THEY HEARD MY STORY  THEY HOBBLED AND WHEELED OVER TO SEE ME  THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES  THOUGH NONE OF THEM SPOKE ENGLISH AND I SPOKE NO SPANISH  THEY SMILED AT ME  SHOOK MY HAND  PATTED ME ON THE HEAD  LEFT GIFTS OF FOOD AND CLOTHING ON MY BED  THEY MOVED ME TO UNCONTROLLABLE FITS OF LAUGHING AND CRYING   WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS I COULD STAND  EVEN MAKE TWO  THREE STEPS  DESPITE NAUSEA  DIZZINESS AND GENERAL WEAKNESS  BLOOD TESTS REVEALED THAT I WAS ANEMIC  AND THAT MY LEVEL OF SODIUM WAS VERY HIGH AND MY POTASSIUM LOW  MY BODY RETAINED FLUIDS AND MY LEGS SWELLED UP TREMENDOUSLY  I LOOKED AS IF I HAD BEEN GRAFTED WITH A PAIR OF ELEPHANT LEGS  MY URINE WAS A DEEP  DARK YELLOW GOING ON TO BROWN  AFTER A WEEK OR SO  I COULD WALK JUST ABOUT NORMALLY AND I COULD WEAR SHOES IF I DIDN’T LACE THEM UP  MY SKIN HEALED  THOUGH I STILL HAVE SCARS ON MY SHOULDERS AND BACK   THE FIRST TIME I TURNED A TAP ON  ITS NOISY  WASTEFUL  SUPERABUNDANT GUSH WAS SUCH A SHOCK THAT I BECAME INCOHERENT AND MY LEGS COLLAPSED BENEATH ME AND I FAINTED IN THE ARMS OF A NURSE   THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO AN INDIAN RESTAURANT IN CANADA I USED MY FINGERS  THE WAITER LOOKED AT ME CRITICALLY AND SAID   FRESH OFF THE BOAT  ARE YOU   I BLANCHED  MY FINGERS  WHICH A SECOND BEFORE HAD BEEN TASTE BUDS SAVOURING THE FOOD A LITTLE AHEAD OF MY MOUTH  BECAME DIRTY UNDER HIS GAZE  THEY FROZE LIKE CRIMINALS CAUGHT IN THE ACT  I DIDN’T DARE LICK THEM  I WIPED THEM GUILTILY ON MY NAPKIN  HE HAD NO IDEA HOW DEEPLY THOSE WORDS WOUNDED ME  THEY WERE LIKE NAILS BEING DRIVEN INTO MY FLESH  I PICKED UP THE KNIFE AND FORK  I HAD HARDLY EVER USED SUCH INSTRUMENTS  MY HANDS TREMBLED  MY SAMBAR LOST ITS TASTE
