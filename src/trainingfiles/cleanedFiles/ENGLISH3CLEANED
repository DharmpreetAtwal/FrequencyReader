THE BOY WITH FAIR HAIR LOWERED HIMSELF DOWN THE LAST FEW FEET OF ROCK AND BEGAN TO PICK HIS WAY TOWARD THE LAGOON  THOUGH HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS SCHOOL SWEATER AND TRAILED IT NOW FROM ONE HAND  HIS GREY SHIRT STUCK TO HIM AND HIS HAIR WAS PLASTERED TO HIS FOREHEAD  ALL ROUND HIM THE LONG SCAR SMASHED INTO THE JUNGLE WAS A BATH OF HEAT  HE WAS CLAMBERING HEAVILY AMONG THE CREEPERS AND BROKEN TRUNKS WHEN A BIRD  A VISION OF RED AND YELLOW  FLASHED UPWARDS WITH A WITCH LIKE CRY  AND THIS CRY WAS ECHOED BY ANOTHER   HI   IT SAID   WAIT A MINUTE   THE UNDERGROWTH AT THE SIDE OF THE SCAR WAS SHAKEN AND A MULTITUDE OF RAINDROPS FELL PATTERING   WAIT A MINUTE   THE VOICE SAID   I GOT CAUGHT UP   THE FAIR BOY STOPPED AND JERKED HIS STOCKINGS WITH AN AUTOMATIC GESTURE THAT MADE THE JUNGLE SEEM FOR A MOMENT LIKE THE HOME COUNTIES  THE VOICE SPOKE AGAIN   I CAN'T HARDLY MOVE WITH ALL THESE CREEPER THINGS   THE OWNER OF THE VOICE CAME BACKING OUT OF THE UNDERGROWTH SO THAT TWIGS SCRATCHED ON A GREASY WIND BREAKER  THE NAKED CROOKS OF HIS KNEES WERE PLUMP  CAUGHT AND SCRATCHED BY THORNS  HE BENT DOWN  REMOVED THE THORNS CAREFULLY  AND TURNED AROUND  HE WAS SHORTER THAN THE FAIR BOY AND VERY FAT  HE CAME FORWARD  SEARCHING OUT SAFE LODGMENTS FOR HIS FEET  AND THEN LOOKED UP THROUGH THICK SPECTACLES   WHERE'S THE MAN WITH THE MEGAPHONE   THE FAIR BOY SHOOK HIS HEAD   THIS IS AN ISLAND  AT LEAST I THINK IT'S AN ISLAND  THAT'S A REEF OUT IN THE SEA  PERHAPS THERE AREN'T ANY GROWNUPS ANYWHERE   THE FAT BOY LOOKED STARTLED   THERE WAS THAT PILOT  BUT HE WASN'T IN THE PASSENGER CABIN  HE WAS UP IN FRONT   THE FAIR BOY WAS PEERING AT THE REEF THROUGH SCREWED UP EYES   ALL THEM OTHER KIDS   THE FAT BOY WENT ON   SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE GOT OUT  THEY MUST HAVE  MUSTN'T THEY   THE FAIR BOY BEGAN TO PICK HIS WAY AS CASUALLY AS POSSIBLE TOWARD THE WATER  HE TRIED TO BE OFFHAND AND NOT TOO OBVIOUSLY UNINTERESTED  BUT THE FAT BOY HURRIED AFTER HIM   AREN'T THERE ANY GROWNUPS AT ALL    I DON'T THINK SO   THE FAIR BOY SAID THIS SOLEMNLY  BUT THEN THE DELIGHT OF A REALIZED AMBITION OVERCAME HIM  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCAR HE STOOD ON HIS HEAD AND GRINNED AT THE REVERSED FAT BOY   NO GROWNUPS   THE FAT BOY THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT   THAT PILOT   THE FAIR BOY ALLOWED HIS FEET TO COME DOWN AND SAT ON THE STEAMY EARTH   HE MUST HAVE FLOWN OFF AFTER HE DROPPED US  HE COULDN'T LAND HERE  NOT IN A PLACE WITH WHEELS    WE WAS ATTACKED    HE'LL BE BACK ALL RIGHT   THE FAT BOY SHOOK HIS HEAD   WHEN WE WAS COMING DOWN I LOOKED THROUGH ONE OF THEM WINDOWS  I SAW THE OTHER PART OF THE PLANE  THERE WERE FLAMES COMING OUT OF IT   HE LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE SCAR   AND THIS IS WHAT THE CABIN DONE   THE FAIR BOY REACHED OUT AND TOUCHED THE JAGGED END OF A TRUNK  FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED INTERESTED   WHAT HAPPENED TO IT   HE ASKED   WHERE'S IT GOT TO NOW    THAT STORM DRAGGED IT OUT TO SEA  IT WASN'T HALF DANGEROUS WITH ALL THEM TREE TRUNKS FALLING  THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME KIDS STILL IN IT   HE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT  THEN SPOKE AGAIN   WHAT'S YOUR NAME    RALPH   THE FAT BOY WAITED TO BE ASKED HIS NAME IN TURN BUT THIS PROFFER OF ACQUAINTANCE WAS NOT MADE  THE FAIR BOY CALLED RALPH SMILED VAGUELY  STOOD UP  AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY ONCE MORE TOWARD THE LAGOON  THE FAT BOY HUNG STEADILY AT HIS SHOULDER   I EXPECT THERE'S A LOT MORE OF US SCATTERED ABOUT  YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OTHERS  HAVE YOU   RALPH SHOOK HIS HEAD AND INCREASED HIS SPEED  THEN HE TRIPPED OVER A BRANCH AND CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH  THE FAT BOY STOOD BY HIM  BREATHING HARD   MY AUNTIE TOLD ME NOT TO RUN   HE EXPLAINED   ON ACCOUNT OF MY ASTHMA    ASS MAR    THAT'S RIGHT  CAN'T CATCH MY BREATH  I WAS THE ONLY BOY IN OUR SCHOOL WHAT HAD ASTHMA   SAID THE FAT BOY WITH A TOUCH OF PRIDE   AND I'VE BEEN WEARING SPECS SINCE I WAS THREE   HE TOOK OFF HIS GLASSES AND HELD THEM OUT TO RALPH  BLINKING AND SMILING  AND THEN STARTED TO WIPE THEM AGAINST HIS GRUBBY WIND BREAKER  AN EXPRESSION OF PAIN AND INWARD CONCENTRATION ALTERED THE PALE CONTOURS OF HIS FACE  HE SMEARED THE SWEAT FROM HIS CHEEKS AND QUICKLY ADJUSTED THE SPECTACLES ON HIS NOSE   THEM FRUIT   HE GLANCED ROUND THE SCAR   THEM FRUIT   HE SAID   I EXPECT    HE PUT ON HIS GLASSES  WADED AWAY FROM RALPH  AND CROUCHED DOWN AMONG THE TANGLED FOLIAGE   I'LL BE OUT AGAIN IN JUST A MINUTE    RALPH DISENTANGLED HIMSELF CAUTIOUSLY AND STOLE AWAY THROUGH THE BRANCHES  IN A FEW SECONDS THE FAT BOY'S GRUNTS WERE BEHIND HIM AND HE WAS HURRYING TOWARD THE SCREEN THAT STILL LAY BETWEEN HIM AND THE LAGOON  HE CLIMBED OVER A BROKEN TRUNK AND WAS OUT OF THE JUNGLE  THE SHORE WAS FLEDGED WITH PALM TREES  THESE STOOD OR LEANED OR RECLINED AGAINST THE LIGHT AND THEIR GREEN FEATHERS WERE A HUNDRED FEET UP IN THE AIR  THE GROUND BENEATH THEM WAS A BANK COVERED WITH COARSE GRASS  TORN EVERYWHERE BY THE UPHEAVALS OF FALLEN TREES  SCATTERED WITH DECAYING COCONUTS AND PALM SAPLINGS  BEHIND THIS WAS THE DARKNESS OF THE FOREST PROPER AND THE OPEN SPACE OF THE SCAR  RALPH STOOD  ONE HAND AGAINST A GREY TRUNK  AND SCREWED UP HIS EYES AGAINST THE SHIMMERING WATER  OUT THERE  PERHAPS A MILE AWAY  THE WHITE SURF FLINKED ON A CORAL REEF  AND BEYOND THAT THE OPEN SEA WAS DARK BLUE  WITHIN THE IRREGULAR ARC OF CORAL THE LAGOON WAS STILL AS A MOUNTAIN LAKE  BLUE OF ALL SHADES AND SHADOWY GREEN AND PURPLE  THE BEACH BETWEEN THE PALM TERRACE AND THE WATER WAS A THIN STICK  ENDLESS APPARENTLY  FOR TO RALPH'S LEFT THE PERSPECTIVES OF PALM AND BEACH AND WATER DREW TO A POINT AT INFINITY  AND ALWAYS  ALMOST VISIBLE  WAS THE HEAT  HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE TERRACE  THE SAND WAS THICK OVER HIS BLACK SHOES AND THE HEAT HIT HIM  HE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE WEIGHT OF CLOTHES  KICKED HIS SHOES OFF FIERCELY AND RIPPED OFF EACH STOCKING WITH ITS ELASTIC GARTER IN A SINGLE MOVEMENT  THEN HE LEAPT BACK ON THE TERRACE  PULLED OFF HIS SHIRT  AND STOOD THERE AMONG THE SKULL LIKE COCONUTS WITH GREEN SHADOWS FROM THE PALMS AND THE FOREST SLIDING OVER HIS SKIN  HE UNDID THE SNAKE CLASP OF HIS BELT  LUGGED OFF HIS SHORTS AND PANTS  AND STOOD THERE NAKED  LOOKING AT THE DAZZLING BEACH AND THE WATER  HE WAS OLD ENOUGH  TWELVE YEARS AND A FEW MONTHS  TO HAVE LOST THE PROMINENT TUMMY OF CHILDHOOD AND NOT YET OLD ENOUGH FOR ADOLESCENCE TO HAVE MADE HIM AWKWARD  YOU COULD SEE NOW THAT HE MIGHT MAKE A BOXER  AS FAR AS WIDTH AND HEAVINESS OF SHOULDERS WENT  BUT THERE WAS A MILDNESS ABOUT HIS MOUTH AND EYES THAT PROCLAIMED NO DEVIL  HE PATTED THE PALM TRUNK SOFTLY  AND  FORCED AT LAST TO BELIEVE IN THE REALITY OF THE ISLAND LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY AGAIN AND STOOD ON HIS HEAD  HE TURNED NEATLY ON TO HIS FEET  JUMPED DOWN TO THE BEACH  KNELT AND SWEPT A DOUBLE ARMFUL OF SAND INTO A PILE AGAINST HIS CHEST  THEN HE SAT BACK AND LOOKED AT THE WATER WITH BRIGHT  EXCITED EYES   RALPH    THE FAT BOY LOWERED HIMSELF OVER THE TERRACE AND SAT DOWN CAREFULLY  USING THE EDGE AS A SEAT   I'M SORRY I BEEN SUCH A TIME  THEM FRUIT    HE WIPED HIS GLASSES AND ADJUSTED THEM ON HIS BUTTON NOSE  THE FRAME HAD MADE A DEEP  PINK  V  ON THE BRIDGE  HE LOOKED CRITICALLY AT RALPH'S GOLDEN BODY AND THEN DOWN AT HIS OWN CLOTHES  HE LAID A HAND ON THE END OF A ZIPPER THAT EXTENDED DOWN HIS CHEST   MY AUNTIE    THEN HE OPENED THE ZIPPER WITH DECISION AND PULLED THE WHOLE WIND BREAKER OVER HIS HEAD   THERE   RALPH LOOKED AT HIM SIDELONG AND SAID NOTHING   I EXPECT WE'LL WANT TO KNOW ALL THEIR NAMES   SAID THE FAT BOY   AND MAKE A LIST  WE OUGHT TO HAVE A MEETING   RALPH DID NOT TAKE THE HINT SO THE FAT BOY WAS FORCED TO CONTINUE   I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY CALL ME   HE SAID CONFIDENTIALLY   SO LONG AS THEY DON'T CALL ME WHAT THEY USED TO CALL ME AT SCHOOL   RALPH WAS FAINTLY INTERESTED   WHAT WAS THAT   THE FAT BOY GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER  THEN LEANED TOWARD RALPH  HE WHISPERED   THEY USED TO CALL ME 'PIGGY '  RALPH SHRIEKED WITH LAUGHTER  HE JUMPED UP   PIGGY  PIGGY    RALPH  PLEASE   PIGGY CLASPED HIS HANDS IN APPREHENSION   I SAID I DIDN'T WANT     PIGGY  PIGGY   RALPH DANCED OUT INTO THE HOT AIR OF THE BEACH AND THEN RETURNED AS A FIGHTER PLANE  WITH WINGS SWEPT BACK  AND MACHINE GUNNED PIGGY   SCHE AA OW   HE DIVED IN THE SAND AT PIGGY'S FEET AND LAY THERE LAUGHING   PIGGY   PIGGY GRINNED RELUCTANTLY  PLEASED DESPITE HIMSELF AT EVEN THIS MUCH RECOGNITION   SO LONG AS YOU DON'T TELL THE OTHERS    RALPH GIGGLED INTO THE SAND  THE EXPRESSION OF PAIN AND CONCENTRATION RETURNED TO PIGGY'S FACE   HALF A SEC'   HE HASTENED BACK INTO THE FOREST  RALPH STOOD UP AND TROTTED ALONG TO THE RIGHT  HERE THE BEACH WAS INTERRUPTED ABRUPTLY BY THE SQUARE MOTIF OF THE LANDSCAPE  A GREAT PLATFORM OF PINK GRANITE THRUST UP UNCOMPROMISINGLY THROUGH FOREST AND TERRACE AND SAND AND LAGOON TO MAKE A RAISED JETTY FOUR FEET HIGH  THE TOP OF THIS WAS COVERED WITH A THIN LAYER OF SOIL AND COARSE GRASS AND SHADED WITH YOUNG PALM TREES  THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SOIL FOR THEM TO GROW TO ANY HEIGHT AND WHEN THEY REACHED PERHAPS TWENTY FEET THEY FELL AND DRIED  FORMING A CRISS CROSS PATTERN OF TRUNKS  VERY CONVENIENT TO SIT ON  THE PALMS THAT STILL STOOD MADE A GREEN ROOF  COVERED ON THE UNDERSIDE WITH A QUIVERING TANGLE OF REFLECTIONS FROM THE LAGOON  RALPH HAULED HIMSELF ONTO THIS PLATFORM  NOTED THE COOLNESS AND SHADE  SHUT ONE EYE  AND DECIDED THAT THE SHADOWS ON HIS BODY WERE REALLY GREEN  HE PICKED HIS WAY TO THE SEAWARD EDGE OF THE PLATFORM AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN INTO THE WATER  IT WAS CLEAR TO THE BOTTOM AND BRIGHT WITH THE EFFLORESCENCE OF TROPICAL WEED AND CORAL  A SCHOOL OF TINY  GLITTERING FISH FLICKED HITHER AND THITHER  RALPH SPOKE TO HIMSELF  SOUNDING THE BASS STRINGS OF DELIGHT   WHIZZOH   BEYOND THE PLATFORM THERE WAS MORE ENCHANTMENT  SOME ACT OF GOD  A TYPHOON PERHAPS  OR THE STORM THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED HIS OWN ARRIVAL  HAD BANKED SAND INSIDE THE LAGOON SO THAT THERE WAS A LONG  DEEP POOL IN THE BEACH WITH A HIGH LEDGE OF PINK GRANITE AT THE FURTHER END  RALPH HAD BEEN DECEIVED BEFORE NOW BY THE SPECIOUS APPEARANCE OF DEPTH IN A BEACH POOL AND HE APPROACHED THIS ONE PREPARING TO BE DISAPPOINTED  BUT THE ISLAND RAN TRUE TO FORM AND THE INCREDIBLE POOL  WHICH CLEARLY WAS ONLY INVADED BY THE SEA AT HIGH TIDE  WAS SO DEEP AT ONE END AS TO BE DARK GREEN  RALPH INSPECTED THE WHOLE THIRTY YARDS CAREFULLY AND THEN PLUNGED IN  THE WATER WAS WARMER THAN HIS BLOOD AND HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SWIMMING IN A HUGE BATH  PIGGY APPEARED AGAIN  SAT ON THE ROCKY LEDGE  AND WATCHED RALPH'S GREEN AND WHITE BODY ENVIOUSLY   YOU CAN'T HALF SWIM    PIGGY   PIGGY TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND SOCKS  RANGED THEM CAREFULLY ON THE LEDGE  AND TESTED THE WATER WITH ONE TOE   IT'S HOT    WHAT DID YOU EXPECT    I DIDN'T EXPECT NOTHING  MY AUNTIE     SUCKS TO YOUR AUNTIE   RALPH DID A SURFACE DIVE AND SWAM UNDER WATER WITH HIS EYES OPEN  THE SANDY EDGE OF THE POOL LOOMED UP LIKE A HILLSIDE  HE TURNED OVER  HOLDING HIS NOSE  AND A GOLDEN LIGHT DANCED AND SHATTERED JUST OVER HIS FACE  PIGGY WAS LOOKING DETERMINED AND BEGAN TO TAKE OFF HIS SHORTS  PRESENTLY HE WAS PALELY AND FATLY NAKED  HE TIPTOED DOWN THE SANDY SIDE OF THE POOL  AND SAT THERE UP TO HIS NECK IN WATER SMILING PROUDLY AT RALPH   AREN'T YOU GOING TO SWIM   PIGGY SHOOK HIS HEAD   I CAN'T SWIM  I WASN'T ALLOWED  MY ASTHMA     SUCKS TO YOUR ASS MAR   PIGGY BORE THIS WITH A SORT OF HUMBLE PATIENCE   YOU CAN'T HALF SWIM WELL   RALPH PADDLED BACKWARDS DOWN THE SLOPE  IMMERSED HIS MOUTH AND BLEW A JET OF WATER INTO THE AIR  THEN HE LIFTED HIS CHIN AND SPOKE   I COULD SWIM WHEN I WAS FIVE  DADDY TAUGHT ME  HE'S A COMMANDER IN THE NAVY  WHEN HE GETS LEAVE HE'LL COME AND RESCUE US  WHAT'S YOUR FATHER   PIGGY FLUSHED SUDDENLY   MY DAD'S DEAD   HE SAID QUICKLY   AND MY MUM    HE TOOK OFF HIS GLASSES AND LOOKED VAINLY FOR SOMETHING WITH WHICH TO CLEAN THEM   I USED TO LIVE WITH MY AUNTIE  SHE KEPT A CANDY STORE  I USED TO GET EVER SO MANY CANDIES  AS MANY AS I LIKED  WHEN'LL YOUR DAD RESCUE US    SOON AS HE CAN   PIGGY ROSE DRIPPING FROM THE WATER AND STOOD NAKED  CLEANING HIS GLASSES WITH A SOCK  THE ONLY SOUND THAT REACHED THEM NOW THROUGH THE HEAT OF THE MORNING WAS THE LONG  GRINDING ROAR OF THE BREAKERS ON THE REEF   HOW DOES HE KNOW WE'RE HERE   RALPH LOLLED IN THE WATER  SLEEP ENVELOPED HIM LIKE THE SWATHING MIRAGES THAT WERE WRESTLING WITH THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LAGOON   HOW DOES HE KNOW WE'RE HERE   BECAUSE  THOUGHT RALPH  BECAUSE  BECAUSE  THE ROAR FROM THE REEF BECAME VERY DISTANT   THEY'D TELL HIM AT THE AIRPORT   PIGGY SHOOK HIS HEAD  PUT ON HIS FLASHING GLASSES AND LOOKED DOWN AT RALPH   NOT THEM  DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT THE PILOT SAID  ABOUT THE ATOM BOMB  THEY'RE ALL DEAD   RALPH PULLED HIMSELF OUT OF THE WATER  STOOD FACING PIGGY  AND CONSIDERED THIS UNUSUAL PROBLEM  PIGGY PERSISTED   THIS AN ISLAND  ISN'T IT    I CLIMBED A ROCK   SAID RALPH SLOWLY   AND I THINK THIS IS AN ISLAND    THEY'RE ALL DEAD   SAID PIGGY   AN' THIS IS AN ISLAND  NOBODY DON'T KNOW WE'RE HERE  YOUR DAD DON'T KNOW  NOBODY DON'T KNOW    HIS LIPS QUIVERED AND THE SPECTACLES WERE DIMMED WITH MIST   WE MAY STAY HERE TILL WE DIE   WITH THAT WORD THE HEAT SEEMED TO INCREASE TILL IT BECAME A
